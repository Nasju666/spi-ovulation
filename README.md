### 🔑 Endpoints & APIs  

This project uses two types of APIs:  

#### 1. **Web API (Browser DOM API)**  
The application leverages the built-in **Web API** to dynamically update and interact with the page. Key functions include:  
- `document.getElementById()` → Access elements such as date input, cycle length, and results containers.  
- `document.querySelector()` → Select elements like buttons and result placeholders.  
- `addEventListener()` → Handle user actions such as clicking buttons, navigating the calendar, or recalculating results.  
- `Date()` → JavaScript’s built-in date API to calculate ovulation, fertility window, and next period.  

##### Example (Web API usage):  
```javascript
document.getElementById('calculateBtn').addEventListener('click', calculateOvulation);

function calculateOvulation() {
  const lastPeriod = document.getElementById('lastPeriod').value;
  const cycleLength = parseInt(document.getElementById('cycleLength').value);

  // Calculate ovulation date
  const lastPeriodDate = new Date(lastPeriod);
  const ovulationDate = new Date(lastPeriodDate);
  ovulationDate.setDate(ovulationDate.getDate() + cycleLength - 14);

  document.getElementById('ovulationDate').textContent = ovulationDate.toDateString();
}
```

#### 2. **External Quotes API**  
The system integrates with a **third-party quotes API** to display motivational health quotes.  

- **GET** `https://thequoteshub.com/api/`  
  - Returns a random inspirational quote in JSON format.  

##### Example Response:  
```json
{
  "text": "Take care of your body. It's the only place you have to live.",
  "author": "Jim Rohn",
  "tags": ["health", "body", "care"]
